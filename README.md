# BST Deletion Program

This Java program implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) with functionalities to insert nodes, delete nodes, search for nodes, and perform in-order traversal. 


# Features
**Insert Nodes**: Add new nodes to the BST while maintaining the BST properties.
- **Delete Nodes**: Remove nodes from the BST, handling different cases (no children, one child, two children).
- **Search Nodes**: Check if a specific value exists in the BST.
- **In-order Traversal**: Traverse the BST and print nodes in ascending order.

# Program Workflow

The program starts by inserting a predefined array of integers into the BST.

It then performs an in-order traversal to display the initial state of the BST.

The user is prompted to enter values to delete from the BST.
After each deletion, the BST is displayed again using in-order traversal.

The program continues to prompt for deletion until the user decides to stop.
